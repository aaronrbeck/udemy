# Goal: Add comments to Prisma API
# 1. Copy the comment type definitions and mark the id as unique
type Comment {
        id: ID! @unique
        text: String!
        author: User!
        post: Post!
    }
# 2. Redeploy the Prisma app
# 3. work with the comment api in graphql playground
#   -update our only post to be published
#   -create a new User
#   - have a new user comment on the one existing post (refer to schema for usage)
#   - fetch all comments (include comment text and author name)
