***"When setting up a field who's value is another one of our
custom types we have to define a function that tells graphql how to get,
in this case author, if we had the post.  We are going to do that by 
difining a new root property on resolvers, so alongside query resolver,
not inside query, we are going to add a new property"***










where I'm stuck

how I resolved issues

video 17 arrays part II
queries with parameters not working
I had parts of resolvers incorrect:

 query: users(query: String): [User]!
 with resolver:
 users(parent, args, ctx, info){
            if (args.query){
                    return users
            }
            return users.filter((user)=>{
                return user.name.toLowerCase().includes(args.query.toLowerCase())
            })
        },

        changing if (args.query){
            to if (!args.query){
                fixed the problem.
I'm not 100% what that crucial ! does.  found answer by comparing to instructor code
    

    ***when I tried to add comments: [Comment!]
    to the resolver Query i failed to include the []***
        

things I've learned:
- I learned how to export and import specific things in and out of files and I learned the difference between a named export and a default export
- Scalar types : just stores a single thing
- Non-scalar types: object / array
- Shift command p, shortcut is dispalayed to the side of whatever you are looking to do.
- I finally understand args, how to define,query and require them, also have a much better understanding of how to 
write simple resolvers
